# bkndmvrgnzr frontend

## Overview

> Please keep in mind that this is a **work in progress**.

This repository includes the frontend of my simple and open source book and movie organizer project bkndmvrgnzr (inofficially also BAMO), which I started building during my work placement at [CEWE](https://www.cewe.de/). It has the following features:

- [x] Keep track of all your books and movies
- [x] Import information from reputable online providers
- [x] Find movies and books by genres, contributors, year of publication and more
- [x] Allow different users to selectively interact with the database via permissions

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Debian-based Linux
distributions as I'm running one myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to
work properly:

- NodeJS as the development base. Install it via the [installation guide](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall).

## How to use it

First install the needed packages via `npm install`. Then build the program via `npm run build` and run it via `npm run preview`.
